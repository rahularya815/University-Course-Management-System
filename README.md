# üéì University Course Management System API

A robust RESTful API built with Spring Boot to manage students, professors, courses, and enrollments in a university ecosystem. This project features a secure authentication system using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) with role-based access control (RBAC) to protect endpoints.

---

## ‚ú® Features

-   **User Authentication**: Secure user registration and sign-in generating a JWT.
-   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Distinct permissions for `STUDENT` and `PROFESSOR` roles.
-   **Professor Management**: Endpoints for professors to manage their profiles and the courses they teach.
-   **Student Management**: Endpoints for students to manage their profiles and course enrollments.
-   **Course Management**: Professors can create, view, and delete courses.
-   **Enrollment System**: Students can enroll in and drop courses, modeling a many-to-many relationship.
-   **Live API Documentation**: Interactive API documentation with Swagger UI for easy testing and exploration.

## üîë Core Concepts & Data Model

The application is built around a relational data model that reflects a typical university structure.

-   **User**: The base entity for authentication. Contains credentials and a role (`STUDENT` or `PROFESSOR`).
-   **Professor / Student**: Profile entities linked to a User via a **One-to-One** relationship.
-   **Course**: Created and managed by Professors. A `Professor` can have many `Courses` (**One-to-Many**).
-   **Enrollment**: The join entity that connects `Students` and `Courses`. This models the **Many-to-Many** relationship where a student can enroll in many courses, and a course can have many students.

## üìú API Documentation & Testing with Swagger

This project includes Swagger UI for live, interactive API documentation and testing. It automatically generates a user-friendly interface from the codebase.

### How to Access

Once the application is running, you can access the Swagger UI in your browser at:

**`http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html`**


### Testing Secured Endpoints

Most endpoints are protected and require a JSON Web Token (JWT). To test them using Swagger UI, follow these steps:

1.  Navigate to the `/signin` endpoint under the **User & Authentication** section.
2.  Expand it and click **"Try it out"**. Enter the credentials for a registered user and click **Execute**.
3.  Copy the `token` from the response body.
4.  At the top right of the page, click the **Authorize** button.
5.  In the dialog box, paste your token in the format `Bearer <your_token>` (e.g., `Bearer eyJhbGciOiJI...`) and click **Authorize**.
6.  You can now access all the protected endpoints using the Swagger UI.

## üîê Security Model: JWT & Role-Based Authorization

The API is secured using JWT. Access to endpoints is restricted based on the user's role, which is embedded within the JWT payload.

-   **Authentication**: Users must call the `/signin` endpoint with their credentials to receive a JWT.
-   **Authorization**: This token must be included in the `Authorization` header of all subsequent requests as a Bearer token (`Authorization: Bearer <your_jwt>`).

### Authorization Rules:

-   **Public Endpoints**: `/register`, `/signin` are accessible to everyone.
-   **Authenticated Endpoints**: All list and view endpoints are accessible to any user with a valid JWT (`STUDENT` or `PROFESSOR`).
-   **Professor-Only Endpoints**: Operations like creating/deleting courses are restricted to users with the `PROFESSOR` role.
-   **Student-Only Endpoints**: Operations like enrolling/dropping a course are restricted to users with the `STUDENT` role.
